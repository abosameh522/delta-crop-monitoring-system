## Phase 0 — Scope and setup

- [x] AOI-A chosen, south edge shifted to `30.75` (Tanta fully inside).
- [x] Focus season 2023, plus 2019–2023 baseline seasons.
- [x] Repo structure, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `PROJECT.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `README.md`.
- [x] `pytest` runs with tests covering config validity and bbox size.

Notes:
- Committed on `main` as `c2c3ea8`; no remote configured and nothing pushed.
- Bbox measures ~47.7 km × ~49.8 km (~2 375 km²), inside the 50×50 km target.

## Phase 1 — Architecture design

- [x] Data source comparison verified against live STAC APIs (Earth Search chosen, CDSE fallback).
- [x] 2019–2023 L2A availability confirmed for the AOI window.
- [x] BOA offset behaviour checked on real pixels; documented the metadata/data disagreement.
- [x] 100 m grid, row/size estimates, storage layout and partitioning.
- [x] Exact Bronze/Silver/Gold schemas and primary keys.
- [x] Weather split into its own Silver table.
- [x] ESA WorldCover cropland mask verified and measured over the AOI.
- [x] Cloud filter 20 % vs 40 % compared per season; 40 % recommended.
- [x] Weekly minimum-observation rule and null semantics.
- [x] Leakage rule for Phase 7 added to risks.
- [x] `config/aoi.yaml` and `tests/test_config.py` updated for seasons, grid and thresholds.
- [ ] User review of `PROJECT.md` architecture (Phase 1 gate).

Notes:
- Architecture is documentation only; no pipeline code written.
- Open data points deferred: heat-wave definition (Phase 5), stress threshold (Phase 7).
